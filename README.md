## SAP repository

### Description
This repository contains assembly code for class Computer Structures and Architectures at Czech Technical University in Prague. Class focuses mainly on logic-circuits, processor architecture and types of memories. Repository contains only assembly code for AVR Butterfly development board(1/3 of class). Class consisted also from FPGA programing(Xilinx-Vivado)(2/3 of class) but I am not versioning that.

### Highlights
lab10/ contains final work, assignment: stop-watch

Stop-watch uses:
- PCINT interrupts
- timer in CTC(TOP) mode with interrupts
- fully interrupt driven program
